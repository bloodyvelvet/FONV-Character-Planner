All libraries are under the /fonv_lib/ folder.

The prototype.js file is only for the test page (fonv_lib_test_page.html)
and is NOT required for the fonv_lib. I've included it the repository for
convenience.

NOTE:
	
	This library is NOT finished. There WILL be bugs/non-working components.
Check the versions on each library to see where they're at.
	
	version 1.0.0 = 100% working

Also, this repository is in a transitional state until I get it all set up.
